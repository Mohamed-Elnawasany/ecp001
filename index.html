<P ALIGN="CENTER">this is the main page for artificial intelligint,Artificial Intelligence can be classified in several ways.The first classifies the AI as either weak AI or strong AI. Weak AI also known as narrow AI,is an AI system that is designed and trained for a specific type of task. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities so that when presented with an unfamiliar task, it has enough intelligence to find a solution. The Turing Test, developed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, is a method used to determine if a computer can think like a human,although the method is controversial. The second example is from Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University. He categorized AI into four types</P>
